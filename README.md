## Handwritten Digits Classification using Keras

## Overview

This project is a deep learning-based classification model that recognizes handwritten digits (0-9) using the MNIST dataset. It utilizes Keras with TensorFlow backend to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for accurate digit recognition.

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits, each represented as a 28x28 grayscale image.

## Results

The model achieves an accuracy of ~99% on the MNIST test dataset.
